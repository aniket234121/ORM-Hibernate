# ORM

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational
databases and object-oriented programming languages.

#### ORM is a programming technique that:

1. Maps Java objects (POJOs) to database tables
2. Allows you to interact with the database using objects, not SQL queries
3. Think of ORM as a bridge between your Java code and relational databases.

### Problems with Traditional JDBC

Using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) directly has several limitations:

| Problem               | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boilerplate Code      | Repetitive code for connection, statement, and result set handling. |
| Manual Object Mapping | You need to manually convert `ResultSet` rows to Java objects.      |
| Too Much Repetition   | Similar code across all DAOs, making maintenance harder.            |
| No Caching            | JDBC doesn't cache data between queries.                            |
| Poor Transaction Mgmt | Manual `commit()` and `rollback()` calls are error-prone.           |
| No Schema Generation  | Tables must be manually created with SQL DDL scripts.               |

### Why Hibernate? (ORM Framework)

Hibernate is the most popular ORM framework for Java.

It solves the problems of JDBC by:

| Advantage                | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Automatic Mapping      | Maps Java classes to database tables using annotations or XML.           |
| ‚úÖ HQL Support            | Hibernate Query Language (HQL) allows object-based querying.             |
| ‚úÖ Less Boilerplate       | No need for repetitive JDBC code.                                        |
| ‚úÖ Caching Support        | First-level and optional second-level caching to improve performance.    |
| ‚úÖ Schema Generation      | Can auto-create or update DB tables based on entity classes.             |
| ‚úÖ Transaction Management | Built-in support for clean transaction handling.                         |
| ‚úÖ Database Independence  | Easily switch between different RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.). |

## Hibernate architecture

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

### 1. Configuration Object

First Hibernate object created in a typical Hibernate application.

Used only once during app initialization.

Reads configuration from:

* hibernate.cfg.xml
* hibernate.properties

üîë **Responsibilities:**

1. Database Connection Setup via config files.
2. Class Mapping Setup ‚Äì connects Java classes to DB tables.

```java
    Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
    cfg.

configure("hibernate.cfg.xml");
```

### 2. SessionFactory Object

SessionFactory object configures Hibernate for the application using the supplied configuration file and allows for a
Session object to be instantiated.

1. The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application.
2. The SessionFactory is a heavyweight object.
3. it is usually created during application start up and kept for later use.

**You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file.**

So, if you are using multiple
databases, then you would have to create multiple SessionFactory objects.

```java 
StandardServiceRegistry ssr = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder()
        .configure("hibernate.cfg.xml").build();
Metadata meta = new MetadataSources(ssr).getMetadataBuilder().build();

SessionFactory factory = meta.getSessionFactoryBuilder().build();

```

### 3. Session Object

A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database.

The Session object is lightweight and designed to be
instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database.

Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a
Session object.

The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be
created and destroyed them as needed.

    Session session = factory.openSession();

### 4. Transaction Object

A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality.
Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA).

```java
    Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
// ... perform DB operations ...
    tx.

commit();  // or tx.rollback();
```

### 5. Query Object

Query objects use SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. A
Query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results returned by the query, and finally to
execute the query.

Used to run:

* HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
* Native SQL

### 6. Criteria Object (alternative to HQL)

* Used for creating object-oriented queries.
* Helps avoid HQL/SQL for dynamic queries.
* Now replaced by JPA Criteria API in newer Hibernate versions.

## Configuration

Hibernate needs mapping information to link Java classes with DB tables.

Configuration is provided via:

1. hibernate.properties (Java Properties file)
2. hibernate.cfg.xml (XML configuration file) ‚Üí commonly used

Place the config file at the root of the classpath.

### Properties inside hibernate configurations

| **Property**                        | **Description**                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hibernate.dialect`                 | Specifies the SQL dialect Hibernate should use (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL).       |
| `hibernate.connection.driver_class` | The JDBC driver class used to connect to the database.                                  |
| `hibernate.connection.url`          | JDBC URL to locate and connect to the database instance.                                |
| `hibernate.connection.username`     | Username for accessing the database.                                                    |
| `hibernate.connection.password`     | Password corresponding to the database user.                                            |
| `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto`            | Auto schema generation: `create`, `update`, `validate`, `create-drop`, or `none`.       |
| `hibernate.show_sql`                | Displays generated SQL statements in the console (mainly for debugging).                |
| `hibernate.format_sql`              | Formats SQL output in the console to be more readable.                                  |
| `hibernate.connection.pool_size`    | Sets the number of database connections in Hibernate's internal connection pool.        |
| `hibernate.connection.autocommit`   | Enables/disables JDBC autocommit mode (set to `false` for manual transaction handling). |

### hbm2ddl.auto property :-

The hbm2ddl.auto property in Hibernate defines how your database schema is handled.

Possible values are:

| **Value**     | **Meaning**                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `create`      | Creates DB schema; drops existing tables.        |
| `update`      | Updates existing schema without data loss.       |
| `validate`    | Validates schema; throws error if mismatch.      |
| `create-drop` | Creates schema on startup; drops it on shutdown. |
| `none`        | Does nothing with schema.                        |

### hibernate Dialect

A database dialect is a configuration option that allows software to translate general SQL statements into
vendor-specific DDL and DML. 

Different database products, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, have their
own variant of SQL, which are called SQL dialects.

**common dialects**

| **Database**      | **Dialect Class**                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| MySQL 8.x         | `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect`     |
| Oracle 12c        | `org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle12cDialect`  |
| PostgreSQL        | `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect` |
| H2 (in-memory DB) | `org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect`         |


## Object States

| **State**      | **Meaning**                                                                  | **Managed by Hibernate?** | **Stored in DB?**          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Transient**  | Object is created in Java, not associated with any Hibernate `Session`.      | ‚ùå No                      | ‚ùå No                       |
| **Persistent** | Object is associated with a Hibernate `Session` and mapped to DB.            | ‚úÖ Yes                     | ‚úÖ Yes (after flush/commit) |
| **Detached**   | Object was persistent but the `Session` is now closed or object was evicted. | ‚ùå No                      | ‚úÖ Yes (until updated)      |
| **Removed**    | Object is marked for deletion (will be deleted on `commit`).                 | ‚úÖ Yes                     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending deletion        |



example

```java

1. Transient

Student s = new Student();  // Just a POJO
s.setName("John");          // No DB interaction

2. Persistent
        
Session session = factory.openSession();
session.beginTransaction();

session.save(s);   // Now Hibernate tracks 's' (it's persistent)

session.getTransaction().commit();

3. Detached
       
session.close();    // After session closed, 's' becomes detached
s.setName("Updated");  // This change won‚Äôt be tracked until reattached

4. Removed

session.delete(s);  // Marks object as removed (still in memory until commit)

```
